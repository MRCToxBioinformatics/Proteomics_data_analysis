# Proteomics Data Analysis

The Proteomics Data Aanalysis material was prepared by the MRC
Toxicology unit
[Bioinformatics](https://www.mrc-tox.cam.ac.uk/facilities/bioinformatics)
and [Proteomics](https://www.mrc-tox.cam.ac.uk/facilities/proteomics) to
provide training in the basics of proteomics analyses.

It assume the userâ€™s data has been processed by Proteome Discoverer, as
per standard Proteomics facility workflows

Tutorials take the form of Rmarkdown notebooks (linked below)

To ensure all the neccessary R packages are installed for you to run the code,
you can install the `Protoemics.data.analysis` package like so:
``` r
remotes::install_github("MRCToxBioinformatics/Proteomics_data_analysis/", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
