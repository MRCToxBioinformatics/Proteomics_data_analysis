provide training in the basics of proteomics analyses.

It assume the userâ€™s data has been processed by Proteome Discoverer, as
per standard Proteomics facility workflows

Tutorials take the form of Rmarkdown notebooks (linked below)

To ensure all the neccessary R packages are installed for you to run the code,
you can install the `Protoemics.data.analysis` package like so:
