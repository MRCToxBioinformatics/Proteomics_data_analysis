### Preamble

There are a number of statistical tests/R packages one can use to perform differential abundance testing for proteomics data. The list below is by no means complete:

- **t-test**: If we assume that the log-transformed SILAC ratios are Gaussian
distributed, a t-test may be appropriate when we have just one condition
(ratio is comparison of conditions = one-sample t-test) or two conditions
(ratio captures one condition, with another condition performed across samples = two-sample t-test)
- **ANOVA/linear model**: Where a more complex experimental design is involved,
an ANOVA or linear model can be used, on the same assumptions at the t-test.
- **`limma`** [@http://zotero.org/users/5634351/items/6KTXTWME]: Proteomics experiments are typically lowly replicated (e.g n << 10).
Variance estimates are therefore inaccurate. `limma`  is an R package that extends
the t-test/ANOVA/linear model testing framework to enable sharing of information
across features (here, proteins) to update the variance estimates. This decreases
false positives and increases statistical power.
- **`DEqMS`** [@http://zotero.org/users/5634351/items/RTM6NFVU]: limma assumes there is a relationship between protein abundance and
variance. This is usually the case, although
  - The relationship with variance is often stronger with the number of
  peptide spectrum matches, or peptides
  
As such, `DEqMS` is preferred over limma for TMT data.
  

Here, we will apply each all the above tests to the same data set and compare the results.

### Input data

We start by reading in a file containing PSM-level output from Proteome Discoverer (PD). This data comes from a published benchmark experiment where yeast peptides were spiked into human peptides at 3 known amounts to provide ground truth fold changes (see below). Two versions of Orbitrap control software were tested, with v3 shown to improve fold-change estimation for low intensity peptides. Here, we will use the data obtained with v3.
