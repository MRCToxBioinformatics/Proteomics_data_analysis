### Preamble

Quantitative proteomics using isobaric tagging such as Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) has a considerable benefit over Label-Free Quantification (LFQ) in that up to 16 samples can be quantified for each Peptide Spectrum Match (PSM). This greatly reduces the extent of missing values that may be present between different MS runs due to the limited number of ions that can be fragmented in each run and the associated issue of peptides being identified in only a subset of runs [@http://zotero.org/users/5634351/items/ME322P2A]. As such, it standardises the features quantified in each sample, simplifying the comparison between samples and increasing quantification accuracy of summarised features such as proteins.

However, TMT does suffer from ratio compression, which should be avoiding by performing quantification with SPS MS3 [@http://zotero.org/users/5634351/items/ZK69WYZ2]. Since quantification is performed in MS3, the TMT ions being quantified are therefore relatively low intensity and as such, removal of low signal:noise PSMs is recommended prior to summarisation to protein-level abundances. In addition, PSMs with high estimated co-isolation/interference should be removed, since the quantification values will be less accurate.

Here, we will assess the following:

- The overall distribution of tag intensities

- How signal:noise relates to missing values 

We will then:

- Filter the PSMs based on signal:noise and co-isolation/interference

- Summarise to protein-level abundances

### Input data

We start by reading in a file containing PSM-level output from Proteome Discoverer (PD). This data comes from a published benchmark experiment where yeast peptides were spiked into human peptides at 3 known amounts to provide ground truth fold changes (see below). Two versions of Orbitrap control software were tested, with v3 shown to improve fold-change estimation for low intensity peptides. Here, we will use the data obtained with v3. For more details, see: [@http://zotero.org/users/5634351/items/LG3W8G4T]

The data we will use is available through the `Proteomics.analysis.data` package.
```{r}
psm_data <- read.delim(
  system.file("extdata", 'benchmark_TMT', 'benchmark_TMT_PSMs.txt.gz',
              package = "Proteomics.analysis.data"))
```


The first step is to remove contaminant proteins. These were defined using the cRAP database. Below, we parse the cRAP fasta to extract the IDs for the cRAP proteins, in both 'cRAP' format and Uniprot IDs for these proteins.
```{r}
crap_fasta_inf <- system.file(
  "extdata", "cRAP_20190401.fasta.gz", 
  package = "Proteomics.analysis.data"
)

# Load the cRAP FASTA used for the PD search
crap.fasta <- Biostrings::fasta.index(crap_fasta_inf, seqtype = "AA")

# Extract the non cRAP UniProt accessions associated with each cRAP protein
crap.accessions <- crap.fasta %>% 
  pull(desc) %>% 
  stringr::str_extract_all(pattern = "(?<=\\|).*?(?=\\|)") %>% 
  unlist()
```

We can then supply these cRAP protein IDs to `parse_features` which will remove features which may originate from contaminants, as well as features which don't have a unique master protein. See `?parse_features` for further details, including the removal of 'associated cRAP'.
```{r}
psm_data_flt <- parse_features(
  psm_data, 
  crap_proteins = crap.accessions, 
  TMT = TRUE, 
  level = 'PSM'
)
```

We now store the filtered PSM data in an MSnSet, the standard data object for proteomics in R. See the `vignette("msnset", package="camprotR")` for more details.
```{r}
# Abundance columns for TMT PD-output start with Abundance 
abundance_cols <- colnames(psm_data_flt)[grepl('Abundance.', colnames(psm_data_flt))]

psm.e <- as.matrix(psm_data_flt[, abundance_cols])
psm.f <- psm_data_flt[, setdiff(colnames(psm_data_flt), abundance_cols)]

# update the column names to remove the 'Abundance.` prefix
colnames(psm.e) <- gsub('Abundance.', '', colnames(psm.e))

# we don't have 'phenotype' data to add so we just define the 
# 'expression' data and 'feature' data

psm.p <- data.frame(spike=rep(factor(c('x1', 'x2', 'x6')), c(4,3,3)), row.names=colnames(psm.e))
  
psm <- MSnbase::MSnSet(exprs = psm.e, fData = psm.f, pData=psm.p)
```

Plot intensity distributions
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.fullwidth=TRUE, fig.cap="TMT intensities"}
plot_quant(log(psm, base=2), method='density')
```

### Removing low quality PSMs
We want to remove low Signal:Noise (S:N) PSMs, since the quantification values will be less accurate and there will be more missing values. We can inspect the relationship between S:N and missing values using the `plot_missing_SN` function.

Note that where the signal:noise > 10, there are far fewer missing values.
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7, fig.fullwidth=TRUE, fig.cap="Missing values per PSM, in relation to the signal:noise ratio"}
plot_missing_SN(psm, bins = 30)
```

We can also look into this relationship at the tag level using `plot_missing_SN_per_sample`. In this case, there is no tag which appears to have a high proportion of missing values when signal:noise > 40. If there were, this may warrant further exploration, e.g was one of the sample preparations inadequate such that fewer peptides were labelled? 
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7, fig.fullwidth=TRUE, fig.cap="Missing values per tag, in relation to the signal:noise ratio"}
plot_missing_SN_per_sample(psm, bins = 30)
```

Based on the above, we will filter the PSMs to only retain those with S:N > 5 using `filter_TMT_PSMs`. Using the same function, we will also remove PSMs with interference/co-isolation >50%.
```{r}
psm_filt_sn_int <- filter_TMT_PSMs(psm, inter_thresh = 50, sn_thresh = 10)
```


### Summarising to protein-level abundances
Now that we have inspected the PSM-level quantification and filtered the PSMs, we can summarise the PSMs to protein-level abundances. 

For PSM to protein summarisation, we will use naive 'sum' summarisation (`MSnbase::combineFeatures(method = 'sum')`). This approach does not appropriately handle missing values, since it either returns NA if any value is missing, or, with `na.rm=TRUE` included, replaces NA with zero where there is at least one finite quantification value for a protein. As such, we will remove the few PSMs with any missing values

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.fullwidth=TRUE, fig.cap="Tally of PSMs per protein"}
psm_filt_sn_int_missing <- psm_filt_sn_int %>% 
  MSnbase::filterNA()
```

Typically, one removes proteins with a single PSM, the so-called 'one-hit wonders', on the basis that these are more likely to be false positive identifications, and the quantification is only drawn from a single observation. 

```{r}
psm_filt_sn_int_missing_n_features <- psm_filt_sn_int_missing %>%
  camprotR::restrict_features_per_protein(min_features=2, plot=FALSE)
```

Below, we perform the summarisation. 
```{r}
protein <- psm_filt_sn_int_missing %>%
  MSnbase::combineFeatures(
    groupBy = fData(psm_filt_sn_int_missing)$Master.Protein.Accession,
    method = 'sum')

```

Finally, we assess the quantification distribution and normalise the protein-level abundances
```{r}
plot_quant(log(protein, base=2), method='density')
```

For this dataset, we see that the protein-level intensity distributions are very similar.
This benchmark experiment was performed by generating 10 samples from defined mixes of
2 peptide samples (human and yeast). As such, we expect near identical distributions for
all samples from the same group. In a typical TMT experiment, you may see more variable distributions.

Regardless, the next step should be to normalise the protein-level intensities. 
Here we will apply 'center-median' normalisation, which in `MSnbase::normalise` is called `diff.median`.
Since the peptide intensities are log-Gaussian distributed, we log~2~-transform them before performing the normalisation.


```{r}
protein_norm <- MSnbase::normalise(log(protein, base=2), method='diff.median')

plot_quant(protein_norm, method='density')
```

Remember that we can check the processing information for our MSnSet if we are in doubt about the processing. Here, it tells us that we log2 transformed and then used `diff.median` normalisation.
```{r}
processingData(protein_norm)
```

Now we have filtered our PSM-level quantification, summarised to protein-level and normalised. We can use this object to perform downstream visualisation, data exploration and statistical analysis etc.

We save the object to disk so we can read it back into memory when we need it
```{r, eval=FALSE}
saveRDS(protein_norm, './results/tmt_protein.rds')
```
