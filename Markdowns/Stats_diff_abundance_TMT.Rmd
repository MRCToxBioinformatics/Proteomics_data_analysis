There are a number of statistical tests/R packages one can use to perform differential abundance testing for proteomics data. The list below is by no means complete:

- **t-test**: If we assume that the quantification values are Gaussian
distributed, a t-test may be appropriate. For TMT, log-transformed abundances can 
be assumed to be Gaussian distributed. When we have one condition variable and we 
are comparing between two values variable in a TMT experiment (e.g samples are 
treatment or control), a two-sample t-test is appropriate. 

- **ANOVA/linear model**: Where a more complex experimental design is involved,
an ANOVA or linear model can be used, on the same assumptions at the t-test.

- **`limma`** [@http://zotero.org/users/5634351/items/6KTXTWME]:
Proteomics experiments are typically lowly replicated (e.g n << 10).
Variance estimates are therefore inaccurate. `limma`  is an R package that extends
the t-test/ANOVA/linear model testing framework to enable sharing of information
across features (here, proteins) to update the variance estimates. This decreases
false positives and increases statistical power.

- **`DEqMS`** [@http://zotero.org/users/5634351/items/RTM6NFVU]: 
limma assumes there is a relationship between protein abundance and
variance. This is usually the case, although the relationship with variance is 
usually stronger with the number of peptide spectrum matches (for TMT experiments),
  
  As such, `DEqMS` should be generally preferred over limma for TMT proteomics.

Here, we will perform statistical analyses on TMT proteomics data.


These are examples only and the code herein is unlikely to be directly applicable
to your own dataset.

### Load dependencies

Load the required libraries.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(camprotR)
library(ggplot2)
library(MSnbase)
library(DEqMS)
library(limma)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(broom)
library(biobroom)

```

## Input data

Here, we will start with the TMT data processed in [DQC PSM-level quantification and summarisation to protein-level abundance](https://mrctoxbioinformatics.github.io/Proteomics_data_analysis/Markdowns/TMT.html).
Please see the previous notebook for details of the experimental design and aim and data processing. 

As a reminder, this data comes from a published benchmark experiment where yeast peptides were spiked into human peptides at 3 known amounts to provide ground truth fold changes (see below). Two versions of Orbitrap control software were tested, with v3 shown to improve fold-change estimation for low intensity peptides. Here, we will use the data obtained with v3. For more details, see: [@http://zotero.org/users/5634351/items/LG3W8G4T]

First, we read in the protein-level quantification data.
```{r}
tmt_protein <- readRDS('./results/tmt_protein.rds')
```

To keep things simple, we will just focus on the comparison between the 2x and 6x yeast spike-in samples (the last 6 TMT tags).

```{r}
tmt_protein <- tmt_protein[,1:7]
print(pData(tmt_protein))
```

## Testing for differential abundance

We will use two approaches to identify proteins with significant differences in abundance:
- two-sample t-test
- moderated two-sample t-test (limma)
- moderated two-sample t-test (DEqMS)

### T-test 
To perform a t-test for each protein, we want to extract the quantification values in a long 'tidy' format. We can do this using the biobroom package


```{r}
tmt_protein_tidy <- tmt_protein %>%
  biobroom::tidy.MSnSet(addPheno=TRUE) %>% # addPheno=TRUE adds the pData so we have the sample information too
  filter(is.finite(value))
```

As an example of how to run a single t-test, let's subset to a single protein.
First, we extract the quantification values for this single protein
```{r}

example_protein <- 'P40414'

tmt_protein_tidy_example <- tmt_protein_tidy %>%
  filter(protein==example_protein) %>%
  select(-sample) 

print(tmt_protein_tidy_example)
```
Then we use `t.test` to perform the t-test. 

```{r}

t.test.res <- t.test(formula=value~spike,
                     data=tmt_protein_tidy_example,
                     alternative='two.sided')

print(t.test.res)


```
We can use `tidy` from the `broom` package to return the t-test results in
a tidy tibble. The value of this will be seen in the next code chunk.

```{r}
tidy(t.test.res)
```

We can now apply a t-test to every protein using dplyr `group` and `do`, making use of `tidy`.


```{r}
t.test.res.all <- tmt_protein_tidy %>%
  group_by(protein) %>%
  do(tidy(t.test(formula=value~spike,
                 data=.,
                 alternative='two.sided')))
```

Here are the results for the t-test for the example protein. As we can see, the 'estimate' column in `t.text.res.all` is the mean protein abundance. The 'statistic' column is the t-statistic and the 'parameter' column is the degrees of freedom for the t-statistic. All the values are identical since have performed the exact same test with both approaches.
```{r}
print(t.test.res)
t.test.res.all %>% filter(protein==example_protein)

```

When you are performing a lot of statistical tests at the same time, it's recommended practice to plot the p-value distribution. If the assumptions of the test are valid, one expects a uniform distribution from 0-1 for those tests where the null hypothesis should not be rejected. Statistically significant tests will show as a peak of very low p-values. If there are very clear skews in the uniform distribution, or strange peaks other than in the smallest p-value bin, that may indicate the assumptions of the test are not valid, for some or all tests. 

Here, we have so many significant tests that the uniform distribution is hard to assess. Note that, beyond the clear peak for very low p-values (<0.05) we also have a slight skew towards low p-values in the range 0.05-0.2. This may indicate insufficient statistical power to detect some proteins that are truly differentially abundant.  
```{r}
hist(t.test.res.all$p.value, 20)
```

Since we have performed multiple tests, we want to calculate an adjusted p-value
to avoid type I errors (false positives).

Here, are using the Benjamini, Y., and Hochberg, Y. (1995) method to estimate the
False Discovery Rate, e.g the proportion of false positives among the rejected null hypotheses.


```{r}
? p.adjust
t.test.res.all$padj <- p.adjust(t.test.res.all$p.value, method='BH')
table(t.test.res.all$padj<0.01)
```

At an FDR of 1%, we have `r sum(t.test.res.all$padj<0.01)` proteins with a significant difference.

FROM HERE, ADD LIMMA AND DEQMS
